Overview of Project

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to refactor a Microsoft Excel VBA code to collect certains stocks information in the year 2017 and 2018 and visualize the profitability of investment in to those stock. This process was first completed in a similar format, however, the goal for this round is to increase the efficiency and performence of the original code.

The Data
The data presented includes two charts with 12 stock information on  different stocks. The stock information contains a ticker value, the date value , the opening, closing and adjusted closing price, the highest and lowest price, and the volume of the stock. The goal is to retrieve the ticker, the total daily volume, and the return on each stock.

Results
Analysis
Before refactoring the code, I began by copying the code that was needed to create the input box, chart headers, ticker array, and to activate the appropriate worksheet. The steps were then listed out in order to set the structure for the refactoring. Below is the instruction and code as written in the file.

'1a) Create a ticker Index
tickerIndex = 0

'1b) Create three output arrays
Dim tickerVolumes(12) As Long
Dim tickerStartingPrices(12) As Single
Dim tickerEndingPrices(12) As Single

''2a) Create a for loop to initialize the tickerVolumes to zero.
' If the next row’s ticker doesn’t match, increase the tickerIndex.
For i = 0 To 11
    tickerVolumes(i) = 0
    tickerStartingPrices(i) = 0
    tickerEndingPrices(i) = 0
Next i

''2b) Loop over all the rows in the spreadsheet.
For i = 2 To RowCount

    '3a) Increase volume for current ticker
    tickerVolumes(tickerIndex) = tickerVolumes(tickerIndex) + Cells(i, 8).Value
    
    '3b) Check if the current row is the first row with the selected tickerIndex.
    'If  Then
    If Cells(i, 1).Value = tickers(tickerIndex) And Cells(i - 1, 1).Value <> tickers(tickerIndex) Then
        tickerStartingPrices(tickerIndex) = Cells(i, 6).Value
    End If
    
    '3c) check if the current row is the last row with the selected ticker
    'If  Then
     If Cells(i, 1).Value = tickers(tickerIndex) And Cells(i + 1, 1).Value <> tickers(tickerIndex) Then
        tickerEndingPrices(tickerIndex) = Cells(i, 6).Value
     End If

        '3d Increase the tickerIndex.
         If Cells(i, 1).Value = tickers(tickerIndex) And Cells(i + 1, 1).Value <> tickers(tickerIndex) Then
            tickerIndex = tickerIndex + 1
        End If

Next i

'4) Loop through your arrays to output the Ticker, Total Daily Volume, and Return.
For i = 0 To 11
    
    Worksheets("All Stocks Analysis").Activate
    Cells(4 + i, 1).Value = tickers(i)
    Cells(4 + i, 2).Value = tickerVolumes(i)
    Cells(4 + i, 3).Value = tickerEndingPrices(i) / tickerStartingPrices(i) - 1
    
Next i
Summary
Pros and Cons of Refactoring Code
Refactoring helps make our code cleaner and more organized. A few advantages of a cleaner code include design and software improvement, debugging, and faster programming. It may also benefit other users who view our projects because it becomes easier to read, as it is more concise and straightforward. However, we do not always have the luxury to refactor our code due to disadvantages. These disadvantages may range from having applications that are too large to not having the proper test cases for the existing codes, which may ultimately pose some risk if we try to refactor our code.

The Advantages of Refactoring Stock Analysis
The biggest benefit that occurred as a result of the refactoring was an decrease in macro run time. The original analysis took approximately one second to run, whereas our new analysis only took about a four of the time (approximately 0.25 seconds) to run. Attached below are the screenshots that indicate the run time for our new analysis.
